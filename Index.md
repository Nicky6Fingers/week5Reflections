# Week 5 Reflections

## *Elegant Javascript* Introduction Reflection

Compared to other introductions i dont think it was bad at all, and i didnt find myself wishing i was done reading it and kept my attention throughout. One of the things that i have always wondered *(but not enough to look myself)* is why javascript and java have the same name when they really have no correlation together coding wise so it was interesting to hear the story behind that even if it was something so simple. It is also true that computers (with coding) you have to be very specific otherwise the computer will not compile the code correctly, i think the most popular example is the teacher asking us how to make a peanut butter sandwich to the class and needing as specif answers as possible to complete the task. But i cant imagine having to redo the entire thing with the hole punches and then have the program do something incorrect not because of the coding but because the hole punch waws a little bit to far to the left!

## Mozilla Javascript Guide Reflection

Javascript is a programming language that is used to make websites more interactive, this can be expanded to the server side and allow for the downloading of files. While they are similar in some regards to java there are other ways in which they are very much differant

<!-- Javascript and Java -->
* Javascript
  * JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java
  * do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
  * __Cannot__ automatically write to hard disk.
* Java
  * Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.
  * Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods.
  * __Can__ automatically write to hard disk.

The Console: Its interesting to me that this is where you might put in code, how often do people open up this window accidentely? i know that i have quite a few times!

<!-- What is ECMAScript? -->
What is ECMAScript?
> i feel like the page doesn't describe this well and i had to do a quick google search to make sure what i thought i was reading is the case, but ECMASScript is the standards of how a few different languages including javascript should be so that as many websites as possible have the same functionality with what the author of the javascript is trying to do. This way the web developers and everyone involved in the process knows what to expect when it comes to javascript or the other coding languages and make sure their website will be able to use it ect.
