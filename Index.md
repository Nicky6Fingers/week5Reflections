# Week 5 Reflections

## __Elegant Javascript__ Introduction Reflection

Compared to other introductions i dont think it was bad at all, and i didnt find myself wishing i was done reading it and kept my attention throughout. One of the things that i have always wondered __(but not enough to look myself)__ is why javascript and java have the same name when they really have no correlation together coding wise so it was interesting to hear the story behind that even if it was something so simple. It is also true that computers (with coding) you have to be very specific otherwise the computer will not compile the code correctly, i think the most popular example is the teacher asking us how to make a peanut butter sandwich to the class and needing as specif answers as possible to complete the task. But i cant imagine having to redo the entire thing with the hole punches and then have the program do something incorrect not because of the coding but because the hole punch waws a little bit to far to the left!
